# Marvel Mania
The is an application I created using the [https://developer.marvel.com](Marvel API).

The technologies used are:
- React
- TailwindCSS
- StyledComponents
- Marvel API

Currently, the application allows you to view 20 characters from the Marvel API, along with a description; if provided. It's the beginning of a work in progress. Future functionality includes: display pages of comics, characters, and other Marvel events; search functionality; and the ability to add commics and characters to a favorites list.
